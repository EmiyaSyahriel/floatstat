# Why?
Page of reasons for why me (and other contributors, if any) are developing this app.

The last app I previously used from other dev offering similar functionality will require
me to open it's app to deactivate the floating window or revoke their permission from Settings,
thus making it inefficient to just respond a dialog that will frequently appears when surfing the
net. Some app that does offer the notification-based control will
asks you to buy the their "Pro" version or "Pro functionality" IAP, or the worst, The app have ads
that triggered by their floating window that will fully cover the entire screen anytime and
anywhere!

  <summary><i>My complaints and cursing, but nvm.</i></summary>
SHAME ON YOU, THE DEV IMPLEMENTING THE "ANYTIME AND ANYWHERE" ADS! I KNOW YOU NEED MONEY, ME TOO! 
JUST DON'T BE GREEDY AND ANNOY YOUR USER! MAY YOU BECAME CONSTANTLY H?RN? UNTIL YOU FIX YOUR APP!

Ehmm, The picture at the front readme is actually a made of btw, not a real screenshot, but you
should get the point anyway.
